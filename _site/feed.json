Up the pipeline it goes, to GitHub.But there‚Äôs something‚Ä¶ Odd about this GitHub repo.Why are there so many other files in here besides the .md one we were just editing?It turns out that all of those .html files and their ilk are what the static site generator Jekyll uses to work its magic.Jekyll: A dream come trueJekyll is the kind of software I dreamed about when I was just starting out in my coding journey, over a decade ago.Everyone who wants to put stuff on the web starts out by learning a bit of HTML and CSS. Maybe JS if they‚Äôre hardcore. Most people very, very quickly realize there is far too much HTML, CSS, and JS in any webpage of real complexity to actually dig in and understand most of it. At best our hand-authoring is used for the occasional, manual, spot check; we leave actually generating the stuff to behemoths like Wordpress and other content management systems.This always bugged me growing up.

Having grown up reading my history I knew that this wasn‚Äôt the way the old hackers would have wanted things to be either.Besides, most of my favorite websites were (are) blogs.

Where I wouldn‚Äôt be constrained to tossing my writing into some obscure CMS binary blog?That‚Äôs exactly what Jekyll is.Jekyll, at its core, gives you a simple promise, after you get it set up (which my experience suggests takes about an afternoon, unless you really want to dive in deep and make something unique ‚Äì which you can!). You focus on writing the .md files. Let me handle actually generating a site for you.And once I‚Äôm done, there‚Äôll be a nice little _site folder sitting right there, filled with .html files that you can open up and peruse in the leisure of your own web browser, locally, just like that first time you authored a webpage by hand.

Naturally this requires automatically running the code you want tested in some regard, right? So it‚Äôs almost like an IFTTT trigger ‚Äì ‚ÄúNew code? Okay, recompile and run all the tests again‚Äù. Fantastic stuff.But wait a minute. Blogs don‚Äôt have tests they need to pass. They‚Äôre literally just words. Why might this be useful? Well, suppose you have a bunch of .md files, and you can generate a really spiffy site with them just by running jekyll build in their parent directory‚Ä¶And that‚Äôs exactly what Netlify does. For free.If you set it up correctly (and this is considerably easy, much easier than Jekyll‚Äôs setup in fact), then every time you push up new content to the GitHub repo where you‚Äôre storing your .md blog posts, and maybe some images and stuff too, Netlify will kick into gear, generate a brand new _site on their end, and then host it for you.This is genius, because those _sites are, well, static! There‚Äôs very little overhead to just hosting a bunch of .html, .css and .js files. Static sites by definition don‚Äôt do anything crazy server-side; any nice little effects are going to happen client-side, and that‚Äôs that.Oh, and if you happen to have a domain lying around on a place like Hover, all it takes to link that domain to the new static site is changing the nameservers.ConclusionI have a blogging workflow now that brings so much joy to my heart.All of my posts are stored and written in plain text, just like back in the days of yore where I used to use org-mode to generate these kinds of things.Yet when I push up to the ‚Äòhub, wizards halfway across the globe use Jekyll to render my little stack of plain text doohickeys into something‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ gorgeous.
